This example consists of creating graphs with React:

A graph library using React and d3. To install,

```
npm install d3
npm install react

npm install react-d3-graph

## [react-vis-force](https://github.com/uber/react-vis-force)
Another graph library that uses the component approach of the react-vis and 
d4-style to the d3-force library. To install,

```
npm install react-vis-force
```


## Run

In the project directory, execute:

```
npm start
```

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Build
In the project directory, execute:

```
npm run build
```

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

## Deploy
You can start the newly created build with a static server,

```

serve -s build
```

Runs the application. The application can be accessed 
at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)
